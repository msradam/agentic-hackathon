    "## AskStreets: Query and Visualizing Street Networks using OSMNX, ArangoDB, and LangGraph\n",
    "Author: Adam Munawar Rahman, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Using powerful libraries like OSMNX, we can retrieve street networks and feature datasets from OpenStreetMap and persist them as graph and collections in ArangoDB. Then, with a  ReACT agent model, feed natural language queries to LLMs to execute complex lookups, run GPU backed graph algorithms, and visualize geospatial coordinates - all for the purpose of giving us insight into the network properties of the geographic area we are analyzing."
