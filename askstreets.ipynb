    "Author: Adam Munawar Rahman, March 2025\n",

    "Using powerful libraries like OSMnx, we can retrieve street networks and feature datasets from OpenStreetMap and persist them as graph and collections in ArangoDB. Then, with a  ReACT agent model, feed natural language queries to LLMs to execute complex lookups, run GPU backed graph algorithms, and visualize geospatial coordinates - all to enable streamlined insights into the network properties of the geographic area we are analyzing."

    "    The `G_ox` graph is an in-memory OSMnx graph representing a street network with these characteristics:\n",
    "    - Each node represents an intersection with geospatial coordinates\n",
    "    - Each edge represents a street segment connecting intersections\n",
    "    - Nodes have attributes like 'x' and 'y' coordinates, 'osmid', and sometimes 'address'\n",
    "    - Edges have attributes like 'length', 'name', 'highway' type, and sometimes 'oneway'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # ALGORITHM SELECTION GUIDELINES\n",
    "    - For centrality: Use nx.betweenness_centrality(), nx.closeness_centrality(), or nx.degree_centrality()\n",
    "    - For connectivity: Use nx.node_connectivity(), nx.edge_connectivity(), or nx.is_strongly_connected()\n",
    "    - For clustering: Use nx.clustering(), or community detection algorithms\n",
    "    - For shortest paths: Use nx.shortest_path(), nx.shortest_path_length(), or ox.distance.shortest_path()\n",
    "    - For accessibility: Compute isochrones or service areas using nx.ego_graph() or custom functions\n",
    "    - For statistics: Use ox.stats.basic_stats() or custom calculations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # CODE STRUCTURE\n",
    "    - Include descriptive variable names and brief comments\n",
    "    - For node lookups by coordinates: Use `node_id = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G_ox, lon, lat)`\n",
    "    - For path finding between points: First find nearest nodes, then compute shortest path\n",
    "    - Focus on the specific algorithm needed rather than general exploration\n",
    "    - Set the final answer as `FINAL_RESULT` - this should be a CONCISE representation of the answer\n",
